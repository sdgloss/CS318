Create a function 'recurCount' that does the following: Start at a given symbol within a grammar. First, the function determines if the symbol is non-terminal. If it is terminal, then it returns the number of values that can take it's place. If it is not terminal, then it loops over every value calling recurCount on each symbol within said value, multiplying their counts together. The results of each iteration of the loop are added to give you the count of a single starting symbol in the grammar. To find the total grammar just loop over each symbol and add each result together for a total.
