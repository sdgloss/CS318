P2 -> There once was a <1CHARACTER>. They lived in <2LOCALITY>. All they wanted in life was <3MAINDESIRE>. They could never obtain it, though, because they were going <4_6OBSTACLE>.

Suddenly, they were threatened with <8THREATENEDWITH>. No one knew that <9TWIST> was in the cards for our protagonist, but just like that, they were able to achieve their goal.
