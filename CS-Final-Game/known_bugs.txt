##Sorry this is raw but I put in 30 hours and fixing every bug was really hard. I hope you enjoy the game how ever flawed it may be. 


#if you choose to shoot in the ghost town before the hidden room is unlocked, the game just crashes

#have to run the execute twice. otherwise it sometimes doesn't load everything. its a weird glitch

#inventory does not work well
#there used to be a dragon but he died

#sometimes you have to enter shoot a couple times before the ending decides to run
